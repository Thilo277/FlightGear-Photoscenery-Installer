# FlightGear-Photoscenery-Installer

This is an installer for FlightGear 2020.3.16, including photoscenery patch by https://github.com/nathanielwarner 

All credits go to him for the patch, i just updated the patches because lines did change, applied the patch and build it on windows x64 and made an installer out of it.

# Where to find the installer?
